      One of my favorite works from college was a video I made using Photoshop
      and a song by the band STRFKR featuring a portion of a lecture by Alan
      Watts. The work was orginally inspired by the following quote from William
      James.

        "Time keeps budding into new moments, every one of which presents a
        content which in its individuality never was before and will never be
        again."

    A collection of some other photos of art works I created while I was in
    college. Ranging from painting to printmaking, some highlights from my 4
    years at LVC.

    Magic the Gathering is a card game I've been playing for many years.
    Sometimes people paint on the cards to alter them in some way, either
    creating new art or extending the existing art.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've dabbled in this in the past and created "proxy cards" which can stand
    in for a real card without actually having the card to play the game. This
    can be useful for particularly expensive cards as a single card can
    sometimes cost over a hundred dollars, but is also just a fun way to explore
    different kinds of art within the game.
