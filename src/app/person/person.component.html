    My name is Robert Hosler and I'm a web developer, gamer, artist, and personality enthusiast. I created this website to share my apps, show
    off some of my artwork, and generally just craft my own little place out here on the web.

    I married my wife Jenny in August of 2020 and we now live in
    Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with our two cats, Ebby and Joseph.

    You may have noticed by now that you are on <em>Roqb.me</em> and not
    <em>RobertHosler.me</em>. You may be wondering why the 'q' is in my name, or
    maybe how to pronounce it...
  </p>
  <p>
    Well the pronunciation is easy! I don't even pronounce the 'q' at all. It
    is just Rob. Or at least that is what <em>I say</em>. Others have chosen to
    pronounce it in all kinds of ways. rock-bee? rah-q-bee? row-cube-e? I've heard
    them all.
  </p>
  <p>As for the WHY, well that is a bit of a longer story...</p>
