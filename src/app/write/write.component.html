        Throughout my life I've occasionally dabbled in the art of writing.
        Below are some of the projects I've worked on.

    <div class="w-75 mx-auto text-justify">
      <p>
        The Objective Personality System is a personality system building on the
        works of Carl Jung and the MBTI. This system is highly complex and
        contains 512 unique personality types. The Subjective Personality site
        was originally created as a site where I could begin to break down and
        explain some of the concepts from this system in written form. The
        creators of the system largely communicate their ideas through video and
        I felt the lack of written material on the system needed to be
        addresseed.

      <p>
        I created a tumblr blog for sharing some thoughts and other writing.
        There isn't much content on it at the moment (as of July 2021), but I'll
        still put it here in case I expand on it in the future.
