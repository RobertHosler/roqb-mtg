            >
            (OPS) is a personality typology system developed by Dave and Shannon
            Powers based on the theories of Carl Jung. While the more well known
            Myers Briggs Type Indicator has 16 types, their system adds
            additional layers of complexity to create 512 unique types. This app
            generates a type description and visual aid for each of the 512
            types in the system by combining various definitions for each of the
            coins.

              >subjectivepersonality domain</a
            >, which was created to host a wordpress blog that I started with
            another member of the community in an attempt to better organize and
            distribute some of the information pertaining to the system to those
            interested.

              Magic the Gathering is a card game I've been playing off and on
              since I was in elementary school. This application allows you to
              draft cards from a set selection of cards in multiple 2 player
              formats with another user.
